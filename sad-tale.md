House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned Stark went to King's landing where he made lots of friends and lived
happily ever after...  He definitely didn't get axe murdered.

Ned then discovered that dogs made everyone happy. He then opened the first ever dog adoption agency. Dogs then brought peace to westeros. They were truly the goodest boys.
